nightmare-puppeteer-server
================

A PoC which exposes [nightmare.js](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare)
and [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) over HTTP.

Note that only one browsing request is served at a time. There is a
request queue, but only a single nightmare-electron browser instance.
Requests are served sequentially in the order received.
The intention is that you run many docker containers which each process
a maximum of one virtual browsing session at a time. This way your
metrics per docker container correspond 1-1 with nightmare performance.



### Docker Usage ###

test running

    docker run --rm -t -p8300:3000 -i --name nightmare kurebio/nightmare-puppeteer-server
    curl "http://localhost:8300/nightmare" -d '(function(nightmare){
      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        console.log("request start")
        nightmare.goto("http://echo.dirkraft.com?echoFormat=application/json")
          .inject("js", "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js")
          .evaluate(() =>
            new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
              setTimeout(() => resolve($("pre").text()), 2000)
            )
          )
          .then(function(text) {
            resolve(text)
          })
      })
    })'
    curl "http://localhost:8300/nightmare" -d '(function(puppeteer){
      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        console.log("request start")
        puppeteer.launch({
          args: ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"],
          defaultViewport: {
            width: 375,
            height: 667,
            isMobile: true,
            hasTouch: true,
            deviceScaleFactor: 2
          }
        }).then(async browser => {
          try {
            const page = await browser.newPage();
            const uaSP = "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 9_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/601.1.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0 Mobile/13B143 Safari/601.1";
            await page.setUserAgent(uaSP);
            await page.goto("http://google.com", {waitUntil: "networkidle0"});
            const html = await page.evaluate(`document.querySelector("html").innerHTML`);
            browser.close();
            return resolve(html);
          } catch(e) {
            console.log(e);
            return reject(e);
          }
        });
      })
    })'


If you aren't familiar with docker (I wasn't when I did this),
it takes time and experimentation to get used to. Basically it involves
setting up: VirtualBox, then docker-machine, then issuing docker
commands to your docker-machine daemon thing (which is running in
VirtualBox). https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/

Pretty much have to do this in all your shells everytime you start your
docker-machine or open a new shell.

    eval $(docker-machine env)

Retrieve and run the latest image from dockerhub. This will
start it in the current shell so you can watch any output.
Quit the container with ctrl-C.

    docker run -t -P -i dirkraft/nightmare-server

In a new terminal tab, get relevant connection points and put them
in some vars.

    eval $(docker-machine env)
    docker_addr=$(docker-machine ip)
    container_id=$(docker ps -f ancestor=dirkraft/nightmare-server -q)
    docker_port=$(docker port ${container_id} 3000 | cut -d ':' -f 2)
    nmserver=${docker_addr}:${docker_port}

So our nightmare-server is running in a docker container exposed to our
host machine, and we can reach it from the host as captured by

    echo ${nmserver}


### Usage ###

If you want to run plain nightmare scripts, make a request
to `/nightmare`. Pass an anonymous function expression in the request
body like in the following example. This navigates to
http://echo.dirkraft.com?echoFormat=application/json and returns the
contents of the `<pre>` element there.

    curl "${nmserver}/nightmare" -d '(function(nightmare){
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            nightmare.goto("http://echo.dirkraft.com?echoFormat=application/json")
                .inject("js", "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js")
                .evaluate(function() {
                    return $("pre").text();
                })
                .then(function(text) {
                    resolve(text)
                })
        })
    })'



#### Driver Scripts ####

There are also the beginnings of support for something I call
*driver script* via `/driver`. Like before, this script is given in
the body of the request.

    curl "${nmserver}/driver" -d '(function(driver){
      driver.goto("http://echo.dirkraft.com?echoFormat=application/json")
        .extract(function() {
          return $("pre").nmtext();
        });
    })'

This makes use of [driver.js](https://github.com/dirkraft/nightmare-server/blob/master/driver.js)
functions like `goto` and `extract` and also a jquery plugin
[jqextract.js](https://github.com/dirkraft/nightmare-server/blob/master/jqextract.js)
which provides `nmtext()`. The idea is to add higher-level functions
to these bindings and reduce the verbosity of client scripts.



#### Bundled Scripts ####

Whether using nightmare or driver scripts, the request can specify a
template to use in place of an explicitly provided script in the request
body.

This example opens a wikipedia page and returns the first article thumbnail
image url. Instead of including the entire driver script in the request
body, this request references a script bundled into nightmare-server and
passes the formatter arguments which it requires. The bundled
[wikipedia.firstimage](templates/wikipedia.firstimage.js)
driver script requires only one formatter argument: **url**.

    curl "${nmserver}/driver?template=wikipedia.firstimage&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlophus_albemarlensis"

outputs

    {"imageUrl":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Male_Gal%C3%A1pagos_Santiago_lava_lizard.jpg/220px-Male_Gal%C3%A1pagos_Santiago_lava_lizard.jpg"}

Templates are [sprintf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprintf) format strings
placed in files in the [templates/](https://github.com/dirkraft/nightmare-server/tree/master/templates)
directory on the nightmare server.

The templates may be either driver or raw nightmare scripts, but
processing a template under the wrong '/driver' or '/nightmare' request
url will probably result in an error.



### Develop ###

Get any dependencies

    npm install

Run the server locally

    ./server.js



### Build ###

For me

    docker build -t dirkraft/nightmare-server .

and to publish to dockerhub

    docker push dirkraft/nightmare-server



### Why ###

Let me count the ways

  - A pet project to get exposure to docker and a bit of nodejs
  - Wanted nightmarejs isolated from my other processes. So turned it
    into a docker-based service.
  - Nightmare and electron don't *just work* on some commodity Linux
    instances. There is some system setup and dependencies to prepare.
  - Docker makes for great *appliances* and AWS ECS supports it well.
